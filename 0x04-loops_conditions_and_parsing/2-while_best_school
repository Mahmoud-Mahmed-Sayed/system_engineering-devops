# This script displays "Best School" 10 times using a while loop.

# 1. Initialize a counter variable (start at 1)
COUNT=1

# 2. Set the 'while' loop condition (loop as long as COUNT is less than or equal to 10)
while [ $COUNT -le 10 ]; do
  # The action to be repeated
  echo "Best School"
  # 3. Increment the counter (important: use the arithmetic expansion $(( )) for calculation)
  COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
